Objectivies:
Developing a BMI Calculator app using Python in Visual Studio involves several key elements and technologies. Below is an overview of the development process, key elements, and technologies used:

Overview:
The BMI Calculator app allows users to input their height and weight, and it calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on this input. The app provides feedback about the user's BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).

Key Elements
User Interface (UI):

Input fields for height and weight.
A button to trigger the BMI calculation.
Display area for the BMI result and its interpretation.
BMI Calculation Logic:

Formula to calculate BMI: 
BMI = Weight (kg)
      ------------
      Height (m)

Function to interpret the BMI value.
Error Handling:

Validation of user input (e.g., checking for non-negative values).
Error messages for invalid inputs.

Result Display:

Display the calculated BMI.
Provide a textual interpretation of the BMI value.
Technologies Used in Visual Studio with Python
Python Programming Language:

Core language for implementing the BMI calculation logic and handling user input.
Tkinter Library:

Standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Provides widgets like labels, buttons, and entry fields for building the UI.

Visual Studio IDE:

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, testing, and debugging Python code.
Offers features like IntelliSense for code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools.
